# GATGNN-VOLTAGE
This software package implements our work of GATGNN-VOLTAGE for the problem voltage prediction. With GATGNN-VOLTAGE, one can predict the material's voltage from:
1. a materials' formation-energy prediction alone or
1. the reaction of a low and high potential energy materials.

Please read our paper for the detailed implementation of GATGNN-VOLTAGE:
